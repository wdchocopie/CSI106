----
# Machine language
* combination of 0 and 1
* each of them  has specific rules for each pattern

----
# Assembly language

* set rules of 0 and 1 to words
* to hardware

----
# High Level languages
* example: Pascal, c, c++
* more related to human language
* Solve human problems
* to function

----
# Translation
* High-level language = source program
* Machine language = Object program
* Method for translation:
   * Compilation
   * Interpretation
