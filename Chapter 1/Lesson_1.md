# Lesson 1

----
# Data process
* Input data -> Computer -> Output data
* Doing single task

----
# Program mable data processor
* Program -> Computer
* Input + program -> Output

----
# Turing machine
* Can do any computation if the appropriate program is provided -> Set of rules
* Without CPU, Memory,....

----
# Von neumann subsystem
* Computer
* * CPU \(Central processing unit\) -> Where calculation and command processing occur
* * * Memory -> Store data + set of rules \(programs\)
* * * ALU \(arithmetic logic unit\)
* * * Control unit \(Fetch and execute\)
* * Input / Output -> Data in / out
* * RAM \(Random Access Memory\) -> Store data from running program, random access, will delete when power off / done executing programs
** Input Data -> Computer -> Output Data **
* Program is also stored in memory
* Using wire system
* Memory and CPU are seperate -> issue when processing multiple commands / programs / task \(Multi threading\)

----
# Sequential execution

Start -> Fetch instruction from memory to CIR -> Increment PC -> Execute -> Stop or return to Fetch

----
# What is computer science?
* Research, apply everything \(Theory, ways\) to optimize computer system
* Know how computer system work
* Develope programs
* Solve problems from technology

----
# Topic in Computer science
* Programming
* AI
* Netowrk
* Data
* ...

----
# Programming
Use coding language to create a program for computer

----
# AI
Machine Learing + Automation task from human

----
# Data Science, machine learning
Understanding and analyzing data for prediction -> automation process and decision making for computer

----
# Network - cybersecurity
Understanding and Analyzing network and security to prevent risk

----
# Computer generations
* First Gen : Using vacuum ball\(bóng chân không\) and wires to calculate and store data
* * Main Electric Component: Vacuum tube
* * Programing language: Machine Language
* * Main memory: Magnetic tapes and drumbs
* * I/O: Paper tapes and punched cards
* * Speed and size: Large and slow
* Second Gen : Replacing vacuum ball with transitor -> Smaller, energy saving, programable
* * Main electric component: Transistor
* * Programming language : Machine / Assembly language
* * Memory : Magnetic core / tape
* * I/O: Magnetic tape and punched cards.
* * Power and size: Smaller than first gen, generate less heat
* Third Gen : IC \(Intergrated Circuis) -> Multiple component on a chip -> have bigger program call OS\(Operating system\) with multitaks\(đa nhiệm), Have programming language such as Pascal, Basic,....
* * Main Electric component : Intergrated Circuits \(IC's\)
* * Programing language : High-level language
* * I/O : Magnetic tape, monitor,...
* * Memory: Large magnetic core, magnetic tape / disk
* Fourth Gen : Core I 3, 5, 7, 9,.... -> Have Desktop, Laptop
* * Main Electric Component: Very-Large-Scale intergration
* * Memory: Semiconductor memory \(Ram, Rom,...\)
* * I/O : Pointing device, keyboard,...
* Fifth Gen : AI: Machine are able to understand and processing human language
* * Main Electric Component : Ultra-Large-Scale Intergration and pararell processing method
* * Language : Understand human language
* * Size : Portable and smaller in size
* * I/O : Trackpad, touchscreen,...

----
# Subsystem and their roles
* CPU : Calculate and process command
* Memory : Store data and programs are running temporarily, will be free after turning off programs / Computer / Task.
* I / O : data in / out
* Control unit : Fetch and execute commands
* ALU : Calculation with logical gate\(NOT, AND, OR, XOR\)
* Cache memory : Store data temporary for CPU.
